After the rather theory-heavy previous chapter, it's time to return the focus to more practical matters, namely how to ask questions. Once we know how to ask what, where, when, why etc. we are really to start asking questions about _Indonesian_ in _Indonesian_ itself.

#### Asking about a people and identities
{{id(id="Siapa", en="who")}} is _roughly_ equivalent to the _English_ word **who** but with a crucial difference. Some properties are considered _inherit_ to the person and as such still use {{id(id="siapa", en="who")}} / **who**, even if we would say **what** in English. A classic example is {{ id(id="Siapa nama anda?", en="What is your name?") }} / **What's your name?**. A persons name is seen as part of their _identity_ instead of a _thing_ attached to them. Luckily there aren't too much exceptions like this.

##### Examples
<dl class="card">
{{ vocab(id="Siapa nama anda?", en="What is your name?", pos="interrogative pronoun + noun + personal pronoun", details="formal", verbose=[
  [["Siapa","intp"], "P"], [["nama", "n"], ["anda", "perp"], "S"] ]) }}
{{ vocab(id="Itu siapa?", en="Who is that?", pos="demonstrative pronoun + interrogative pronoun", verbose=[
  [["Itu", "demp"], "S"], [["siapa", "intp"], "P"]]) }}
{{ vocab(id="Siapa dia buat kamu?" en="What is she / he to you", pos="interogative pronoun + personal pronoun + verb + personal pronoun", verbose=[
  [["Siapa", "intp"], "Pred"], [["dia", "perp"], "S"], ["buat", "v"], ["kamu", "perp"]] )}}

#### Asking about a thing or action
The word {{id(id="apa", en="what")}} is used for asking about a _thing_ or _action_, often similar **what**. However, in can express a lot more and is very flexible. Especially its positioning within a sentence can drastically change the meaning of {{id(id="apa", en="what")}}. Lets start with the three most basic forms you will come across:

1. _Subject + verb / noun + apa?_
2. _Apa + subject + verb?_
3. _Apa + noun phrase?_

The first form is the classic _what-question_, for example {{id(id="Kamu makan apa?", en="What did you eat?")}} translates to **What did you eat?**. This should be very straight forward and what you would expect when people say that {{id(id="apa", en="what")}} means **what**. So what happens when we move {{id(id="apa", en="what")}} from the end to the beginning of the sentence?

When {{id(id="apa", en="what")}} is placed in front of the sentence its _grammatical function_ changes to a _question particle_. Essentially, it turns the whole sentence into a yes/no question. Changing our previous sentence {{id(id="Kamu makan apa?", en="What did you eat?")}} / **What did you eat?** to {{id(id="Apa kamu makan?", en="Did you eat?")}} results in the yes/no question **Did you eat?** or **Have you eaten?**.

In this form {{id(id="apa", en="what")}} mainly functions as a _grammatical marker_ and its literal translation is gone. Given the last example, you might think that it still has a direct translation in **did** or **have**. But this is only the result of trying to express _Indonesian_ in the context of the _English_ language. This becomes clear when we add an _auxiliary verb_ like {{id(id="akan", en="will")}} / **will** or {{id(id="bisa", en="can")}} / **can**.

For example, {{id(id="Apa kamu akan makan?", en="Will you eat?")}} / **Will you eat?** and {{id(id="Apa kamu bisa makan?", en="Can you eat?")}} / **Can you eat?**, both lack any literal translation of {{id(id="apa", en="what")}}, it is purely a _grammatical marker_. As mentioned before, _Indonesian_ is _very_ context heavy and fluid. Instead of recontextualize everything to _English_ or any other language, try to take _Indonesian_ for what it is and get used to its native concepts.

Finally, the third form _Apa + noun phrase?_, surprisingly, expresses a _what-question_ like the first form if {{id(id="apa", en="what")}} is followed by a _noun phrase_. {{id(id="Apa kamu hobi?", en="What is your hobby?")}} means the same as {{id(id="Kamu hobi apa?", en="What is your hobby?")}}, **What is your hobby?**. The difference is that the former sounds more formal and stiff while the later more casual and natural.

{{quiz(id="Saya _ minum air", en="I have drunk water", options=["sudah","akan","sedang","telah"], answers=["sudah","telah"], note="Sudah and telah both indicate the correct aspect but since the subject is Saya, which is formal, it would sound more natural to use telah")}}
