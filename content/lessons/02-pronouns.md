Pronouns in _Indonesian_ are gender-neutral but feature distinct words depending on the formality. In every day conversations the casual forms are, depending on the place, usually accepted, but their formal counterparts should still be used in professional situations or with the elders, for example.

#### First Person
As seen in the previous lesson {{id(id="saya", en="I")}} means **I**, more specifically it is the _formal_ word for I, its _casual_ counterpart is {{id(id="aku", en="I")}}. An even more informal variant is {{id(id="gw", en="I")}}, slang you might come across on the internet.

You should stay away from slang as someone new to a language, especially when you cannot read the room. As a rule of thumb, you cannot go wrong with starting with the _formal_ forms and easing into the more _casual_ forms if offered by your conversation partner.

Unlike _I_ the words for _We_ are not split by _formality_ but by _clusivity_. The following examples showcase the usage of {{id(id="kami", en="we")}} and {{id(id="kita", en="we")}}.

##### Vocabulary
<dl class="card grid4">
{{ vocab(id="saya", en="I", pos="pronon", details="formal") }}
{{ vocab(id="aku", en="I", pos="pronoun", details="casual") }}
{{ vocab(id="gw", en="I", pos="pronoun", details="slang") }}
{{ vocab(id="kami", en="We", pos="pronoun", details="exclusive") }}
{{ vocab(id="kita", en="We", pos="pronoun", details="inclusive") }}
{{ vocab(id="sempai", en="to arrive", pos="verb") }}
{{ vocab(id="kan", en="right? / isn't it?", pos="particle") }}
{{ vocab(id="teman", en="friend", pos="noun") }}
</dl>

##### Examples
<dl class="card examples">
{{ vocab(id="Kami sempai besok", en="We will arrive tomorrow", pos="pronoun + verb + adverb") }}
{{ vocab(id="Kita teman, kan?", en="We are friends, right?", pos="pronoun + noun + particle") }}
</dl>

{{ id(id="Kami", en="we") }} _excludes_ the person being talked to. In the sentence {{ id(id="Kami akan tiba besok", en="We will arrive tomorrow") }} you are informing someone, who is not with you, that your group will arrive tomorrow. {{ id(id="Kita", en="we") }} on the other hand, _includes_ the person you are talking with, as shown in {{ id(id="Kita teman, kan?", en="We are friends, right?") }} which seeks confirmation from the other person.

As discussed previously, _Indonesian_ heavily relies on context and often omits words; both examples follow this sentiment. {{ id(id="Kami sempai besok", en="We will arrive tomorrow") }} leaves out {{ id(id="akan", en="will") }} the word for **will** and in the case of {{ id(id="Kita teman, kan") }} the _verb_ **to be / are** which is {{ id(id="adalah", en="to be") }}. Depending on your choice of pronoun, or rather how formal they are, you might want to use "proper" complete sentences instead.

#### Second person
<dl class="card grid4">
{{ vocab(id="anda", en="you", pos="pronon", details="formal") }}
{{ vocab(id="kamu", en="you", pos="pronoun", details="casual") }}
{{ vocab(id="lu", en="you", pos="pronoun", details="slang") }}
{{ vocab(id="kalian", en="you all", pos="pronoun", details="plural") }}
{{ vocab(id="tahu", en="to know", pos="verb") }}
</dl>

##### Examples
<dl class="card examples">
{{ vocab(id="Kamu tahu Michi?", en="Do you know Michi?", pos="pronoun + verb + object") }}
{{ vocab(id="Kalian sedang apa?", en="What are you all doing?", pos="pronoun + adverb + interrogative pronoun") }}
</dl>

Just like first person pronouns, the second person is split into a _formal_ and _casual_ form, {{ id(id="Anda", en="You") }} and {{ id(id="Kamu", en="You")}} respectively. Unlike _English_, _Indonesian_ has a separate word for the plural of _You_ or _You all_: {{id(id="Kalian", en="You (plural)")}}. It has a _casual_ tone and can be used in everyday conversations. There are more polite alternatives, but they are only rarely used and ignored at this point.

#### Third person
<dl class="card grid2">
{{ vocab(id="Ia", en="He / She", pos="pronoun", details="formal, gender-neutral") }}
{{ vocab(id="Dia", en="He / She", pos="pronoun", details="casual, gender-neutral") }}
{{ vocab(id="Beliau", en="He / She", pos="pronoun", details="very formal, gender-neutral") }}
{{ vocab(id="Mereka", en="They", pos="pronoun", details="plural, gender-neutral") }}
</dl>

By now the pattern should be clear; once again there is the _formal_ {{id(id="Ia", en="He/She")}} and _casual_ {{id(id="Dia", en="He/She")}}, but this time there is an even more _formal_ version, {{id(id="Beliau", en="He/She")}}. The latter is reserved to address someone _highly respected_. Using it in a casual context might accidentally sound arrogant or mocking instead. Finally, there is the plural third person {{id(id="Mereka", en="They")}} meaning **They**.

You might have noticed that all these pronouns are _gender-neutral_. The same is true for most nouns, adjectives, and verbs. It is possible to specify the gender of a noun if needed, but by default they are assumed to be _gender-neutral_.

##### Quiz
{{quiz(id="_ suka kucing", en="I like cats", options=["Kita", "Aku", "Dia", "Saya"], answers=["Aku", "Saya"])}}
{{quiz(id="_ di mana?", en="Where are you all?", options=["Saya", "Ia", "Kalian", "Kamu"], answers=["Kalian"])}}
{{quiz(id="Kucing _ hitam", en="His/Her cat is black", options=["ia", "dia", "gw", "kita"], answers=["ia", "dia"])}}

#### Possessive
As the name implies _possessive pronouns_ indicate the possession of something. In english every _personal pronoun_ has its own corresponding _possessive pronoun_: **I** -> **My**, **You** -> **Yours**, **She** -> **Her** and so on. However, _Indonesian_ uses different systems to express the same idea. Instead of using special _pronouns_ the _noun_ itself is modified, either directly or by appending a _personal pronoun_.

To say **My cat** is as easy as adding one of the _first person pronoun_, {{id(id="Saya", en="I")}} / {{id(id="Aku", en="I")}} etc, after the noun for **cat** resulting in {{id(id="Kucing saya", en="My cat")}} / **My cat**. This works for all other _personal pronouns_ as well, regardless of the person used like {{id(id="Mobil mereka", en="Their car")}} / **Their car**. This can also be expanded to whole _noun phrases_ like {{id(id="Mobil merah mereka", en="Their red car")}} / **Their red car**.

Naturally it wouldn't be _Indonesian_ if there wasn't a shorter version as well. Instead of adding the whole pronoun after the noun we modify it directly with a corresponding _suffix_:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Suffix</th>
    <th>Pronoun</th>
    <th>Meaning</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-ku</td>
    <td>{{id(id="Aku", en="I")}}</td>
    <td>My</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-mu</td>
    <td>{{id(id="Kamu", en="You")}}</td>
    <td>Your</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>-nya</td>
    <td>{{id(id="Ia", en="He/She")}}</td>
    <td>His / Hers</td>
  </tr>
</table>

##### Examples
<dl class="examples card">
{{ vocab(id="Kucing saya", en="My cat", pos="noun + possessive pronoun") }}
{{ vocab(id="Kucingnya hitam", en="Her black cat", pos="noun + pronoun suffix + adjective", verbose=[
  [["Kucing", "n"], ["-nya", "posp"], "S"], ["hitam", "adj"]
]) }}
{{ vocab(id="Kucing putihmu", en="Your white cat", pos="subject + adjective + pronoun suffix") }}
{{ vocab(id="Kucingnya juga punyaku", en="His cat is also mine", pos="noun + pronoun suffix + adverb + verb + pronoun suffix", verbose=[
  [["Kucing", "n"], ["-nya", "posp"], "S"], [["juga", "adverb"], ["punya", "verb"], ["-ku", "posp"], "P"]
]) }}
</dl>

The first two sentences are pretty straightforward and show the basic usage of both the explicit _pronoun_ and _suffix_ version. Moving on to the third sentence, {{id(id="Kucing putihmu", en="Your white cat")}} / **Your white cat** uses a slight variation. Instead of modifying the _noun_ {{id(id="kucing", en="cat")}}, the whole _noun phrase_ is changed by adding the _suffix_ {{id(id="-mu", en="your")}} to the final adjective {{id(id="putih", en="white")}} / **white**. This variation is often used in casual speech for short phrases.

Finally, {{id(id="Kucingnya juga punyaku", en="His cat is also mine")}} is a bit more complex. The verb {{id(id="punya", en="to have")}} means **to have**, which when modified with a _possessive pronoun suffix_ turns into a general possessive to express things like {{id(id="Ini punyaku", en="This is mine")}} / **This is mine**.

#### Demonstratives

<dl class="card grid3">
{{ vocab(id="ini", en="this / these", pos="demonstrative") }}
{{ vocab(id="itu", en="that / those", pos="demonstrative") }}
{{ vocab(id="adalah", en="to be / is / are", pos="verb") }}
</dl>

Finally, we cover the two _demonstratives_ {{id(id="ini", en="this / these")}} / **this** and {{id(id="itu", en="that")}} / **that**. They can either stand in front as a _demonstrative pronoun_ or following a _noun_ or _noun phrase_ as a _demonstrative determiner_. Lets look at a simple example.

In the sentence {{id(id="Ini kucing hitam lucu", en="This is a cute black cat")}}, {{id(id="ini", en="this")}} is a _demonstrative pronoun_ as signaled by its position in the front. This shifts the focus of the sentence and turns {{id(id="ini", en="this")}} / **this** into the _subject_, resulting in the translation **This is a cute black cat**.


{{id(id="Kucing hitam ini lucu", en="This black cat is cute")}} utilizes {{id(id="ini", en="this")}} as a _demonstrative determiner_ which transforms the whole phrase **This black cat** into a complete _noun phrase_ and the _subject_. In this case it leads to a subtle shift in emphasis and meaning to **This black cat is cute**.

Take note how the position of {{id(id="ini", en="this")}} or {{id(id="itu", en="that")}} within a sentence influences the _noun phrase_ being modified. In this case, **This is a [cute black cat]** vs **[This black cat] is cute**. This has further grammatical implications depending on the context this form is used in. While {{id(id="Ini kucing hitam saya", en="This is my black cat")}} / **This is my black cat** is a grammatically correct sentence, {{id(id="Kucing hitam ini saya")}} is wrong and makes no sense.

The reason for this is that both {{id(id="ini", en="this")}} and {{id(id="saya", en="I")}} compete as a _modifier_ for the _noun phrase_ {{id(id="kucing hitam")}}. But in _Indonesian_ the _demonstrative determiner_, meaning {{id(id="ini", en="this")}} or {{id(id="itu", en="that")}} at the end of a _noun phrase_, structurally _completes_ it. The _noun phrase_ cannot be further modified afterward and thus {{id(id="saya", en="I")}} can no longer function as a _possessive pronoun_. Additional meaning can still be added with a predicate forming a new, separate _phrase_ like for example, {{id(id="Kucing hitam ini besar dan luca", en="This black cat is big and cute")}} / **[This black cat] is [big and cute]**.
