Time to learn how to greet and say goodbye. Similar to many other languages, _Indonesian_ combines a form of well-wishes with the time of the day to form greetings. One of the meanings of the word {{id(id="selamat", en="safe / well / congratulation")}} is **safe** / **well**, and combined with {{id(id="pagi", en="morning")}} / **morning** creates the phrase {{id(id="selamat page", en="good morning")}} / **good morning**.

{{ vocab(id="selamat", en="safe / well / congratulation", pos="adj / noun") }}
{{ vocab(id="pagi", en="morning", pos="noun") }}
{{ vocab(id="siang", en="noon", pos="noun") }}

One phrase that might trip up _English_ speaker is {{id(id="selamat malam", en="good night")}} / **good night**. In _Indonesian_ it is used both as greeting and farewell used at night. The same applies to all the other times of the day as well. Some specific situations have their own phrases.

When two people or parties separate, with one of them leaving and the other staying, for example. In this case the _staying_ person would say {{id(id="selamat jalan", en="goodbye / safe trip")}} which means **goodbye** / **safe trip**. Likewise the person who _leaves_ would say {{id(id="selamat tinggal", en="goodbye")}} which literally means to **stay safe**, but is more akin to a generic **goodbye**.

##### Examples
<dl class="card">
{{ vocab(id="Selamat sore", en="Good afternoon", pos="adjective + noun (phrase)") }}
{{ vocab(id="Selamat malam", en="Good night", pos="adjective + noun (phrase)", details="both a greeting and farewell") }}
{{ vocab(id="halo, apa kabar?", en="Hello, how are you?", pos="interjecton + predicate + subject") }}
</dl>

#### Casual

Casual speech and especially slang is ever shifting and evolving, not to mention the hundreds of local languages spread across _Indonesia_. Again, be careful with overly casual speech and slang as a language learner. That being said, it can be difficult to follow _Indonesian_ used by younger people without it, especially online.

##### Examples
<dl class="card grid1">
{{ vocab(id="hai", en="hi / hey", pos="interjection", details="casual but neutral") }}
{{ vocab(id="woy", en="hey! / yo!", pos="interjection", details="very casual slang") }}
{{ vocab(id="Udah makan belum", en="Have you eaten yet?", pos="phrase", details="common greeting, similar to How are you?, not literal about food") }}
{{ vocab(id="Met pagi", en="Good morning", pos="phrase", details="met is a common abbreviation of selamat")}}
{{ vocab(id="Piye kabarmu?", en="How are you?", pos="phrase", details="local javanese expression") }}
